Apart from being the birthplace and center of student-led organizations, it is also the abode of the two fan-favorite MVP cats, Dongyan and Barbie.\n\nThose who arrive on campus in the early mornings may chance upon Dongyan and Barbie playing chase by the MVP entrance. Other times, they would sit proudly on the front desk, nap on the press stands by the staircase, or pose for the students taking photographs of them.\n\n“Dongyan [has] been a resident there for quite a long time, and he actually got his name from the [security] guard stationed there,” Guce explains. The story being passed around goes that when someone asks about the cat, one would respond “Kay Dong ‘yan (That’s Dong’s),” referring to Fortunato “Dong” Butlig, a security guard formerly stationed at MVP.\n\nBarbie, on the other hand, started residing in the building because a student asked Kuya Dong to take care of her. Guce notes that requesting school staff to foster cats is prohibited. However, Barbie was already at MVP, and Dongyan decided to adopt her. As of writing, Kuya Dong is no longer stationed at MVP, and instead regularly makes his rounds around the college parking lots, the dorms, the Institute of Social Order area, and Areté.",
