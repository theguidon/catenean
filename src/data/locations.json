Loved by many, she first madde rounds in many students' hearts by frequenting the ground floor of the SOM building, before she followed Resuello up to his lounge room at the CTC's fifth floor. She seemingly followed wherever caring hands would take her, as she would gladly stay in areas with people who offered food for her.\n\nResuello often feeds Parada as his main alaga (pet). His feeding other cats, however, seemingly sparked a hint of jealousy in Prada, prompting her to move to the opposite end of the CTC's fifth floor. As a result, Resuello would  have to bring her back to this lounge area to feed her. Before becoming known as CTC's resident queen cat, she was first a friendly cat who enjoyed finding comfort where it was available.\n\nRecalling his early daays working at the Ateneo, Johnson once encountered a young Prada who seemingly enojyed laying on his bag, \"She had a fondness for lying on my bag, and I figured, well, she lives at SOM, so she must by sosyal (fancy). Prada's a good name for her, and it stuck,\" Johnson shares.\n\nPrada, notable for her friendliness, frequently entered random offices and rooms within the CTC-SOM buildings. Unfortunately, shortly after her son Pao-Pao died in a roadkill incident, Prada began losing her appetite, which led to her own passing.\n\nResuello soon announced Prada's death on his Facebook profile, where many shared their condolences. Afterward, she was buried in the SOM Forest next to her son.",
